## How Pattern Detection Works

The application uses JavaScript-based algorithms to analyze candlestick formations and identify patterns based on the following:

- Candle body size and position
- Shadow (wick) length ratios
- Multi-candle relationships and sequences
- Price movement direction

When a pattern is detected, it's annotated directly on the chart with color-coded markers:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green markers for bullish patterns
- ðŸ”´ Red markers for bearish patterns
- âšª Grey markers for neutral patterns
